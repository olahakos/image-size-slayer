# Image Size slayer

It's a hackathon project at the 24h Stupid Hackathon Sverige.

Plot: Reduce file size of images (e.g. so that you can send them to your grandmother who is not on a modern connection) by returning a smaller, similar image instead of the original.

## Run the app

Before you start the app you have to add your Google and Bing API keys to the `conf/config.js` file.

```
npm install
npm run start
```
